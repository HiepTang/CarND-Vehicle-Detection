# Vehicle Detection Project
The goal of this project is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles on a video (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4).
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature extraction.
* Apply a color transform, histogram of color and spatial binning of color.
* Prepare data and train a classifier.
* Implement a sliding window search technique and use it to search vehicles on test images.
* Implement pipeline and run on video stream.
* Combine with the advanced lane finding project.
